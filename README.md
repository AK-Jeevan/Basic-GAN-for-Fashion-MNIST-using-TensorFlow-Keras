# Basic-GAN-for-Fashion-MNIST-using-TensorFlow-Keras
A simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to generate clothing images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The project uses fully connected (Dense) layers for both the generator and discriminator, making it ideal for learning and experimenting with GAN fundamentals.
